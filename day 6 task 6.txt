  1. a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, 
 a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the  respective class properties to these values.

class movie {
  constructor(title, studio, rating) {
    this.title = title;
    this.studio = studio;
    this.rating = rating;
  }

  getrating() {
    return "the rating is  " + this.rating;
  }
}


  b) The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided.
 
class movie {
    constructor(title, studio, rating){
        this.title = title;
        this.studio = studio;
        this.rating = "PG";
    }
}
   c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument,
and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG".
You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need
not be full 
 public static Movie[] getPG(Movie[] mov) {
 Movie[] pgMov = new Movie[mov.length];
 int newArrayIndex = 0;
 for (int i = 0; i < mov.length; i++) {
 if (mov[i].rating.equals(“PG”)) {
 pgMov[newArrayIndex] = mov[i];
 newArrayIndex++;
 }
 }
 return pgMov;
}

   d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”,
  the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”

const CasinoRoyale = new movie( "Casino Royal", "Eon Productions", "PG13");


3.Write a "person" class to hold all the details. 

class person{
        constructor(name,id){
            this.name = name;
            this.id = id;
        }
        add_Address(add){
            this.add = add;
        }
        getDetails(){
            console.log(`Name is ${this.name},
            Address is: ${this.add}`);
        }
    }
      
    let person1 = new person('sathish',25);
    person1.add_Address('thanjavur');
    person1.getDetails();

 4.Write a class to calculate the uber price.

  let baseFee = .44
let cities = ["Thanjavur", "kumbakonam", "india", ]
let uberRates = [5, 10, 15]
let customerName = "sathish" 
let customerCity = "Thanjavur" 

console.log("Hello", customerName+ ", welcome to the Uber Rate Program")

function getRate(customerCity) {
  
  function uberRate(customerCity, index) {
    
    let finalRate = (uberRates[index]) * baseFee
    return finalRate
  }
  
  console.log(customerCity, "rate is:", uberRate(customerCity, cities.indexOf(customerCity)))
}

getRate(customerCity)
